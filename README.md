## 📍 Overview

The Img2Text_Pytesseract project is a robust software tool designed to convert images to text using optical character recognition (OCR) technology, facilitated by the pytesseract library(integration of  other OCR libraries is coming soon). It features a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and view the extracted text. The project simplifies the process of handling various image formats and enhances text detection and organization. This makes Img2Text_Pytesseract invaluable for digitizing printed documents and making them editable and searchable, catering to both educational and professional needs.

## 🧩 Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | Based on Python, uses pytesseract for OCR, Streamlit for UI, pillow_heif for image handling, and pyngrok for tunneling. Structured with main app and separate processing script. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | The codebase maintains high-quality standards with clear structure, comments, and well-documented code, ensuring readability and maintainability.|
| 📄 | **Documentation** | While not extensive, the code detailed documentation within the notebooks, includes inline comments  and helpful links, explaining key steps and the purpose of certain operations.|
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | Integrates pytesseract for OCR, Streamlit for web interface, and pyngrok to expose local server to the internet. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | High modularity with clear separation between image processing and user interface logic. Enhances maintainability and scalability. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | Performance largely depends on pytesseract's OCR capabilities and image processing efficiency. Not benchmarked in the repository. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | No specific security measures or data protection techniques documented. Use of pyngrok may require security considerations. |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**  | Uses pytesseract, Streamlit, pillow_heif, and pyngrok. Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` for easy setup. |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**   | Scalable in terms of functionality through Streamlit and potential cloud deployment but lacks explicit scaling strategy. |
